I aggregated Citibike data from December 2016 and February 2020.I cleaned my data and created a new CVS file using pandas with an end goal of showing how Citibike expanded their stations from 2016 to 2020. Visible in the story page is a large growth of stations throughout the city with a high concentration of expansion in upper Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. I also wanted to see how average trip duration changes by age. As shown in a dashboard average trip duration in December 2016 was longest for 66-75 year old age group and shortest for 16-25 year old age group. In February 2020, average trip duration was longest for the 46-55 year old group followed by the 16-25 year old group and the 26-35 year old group. This could be from the expansion of Citibike as commuter bikes to and from work (longer trips). In another dashboard I have the top 10 stations for starting and ending a journey in February 2020. These stations are all in highly populated commuter areas- near Grand Central Station, Penn Station etc. There is also a popular starting station by the Highline- a very popular tourist area.
